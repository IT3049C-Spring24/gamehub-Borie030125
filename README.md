GameHub(Final Project, Team 10)
===================================

Instruction: This project was developed by Huy, Austin and Xuan. Since we were not familiar with the use of Folk during the development process, we all completed the work through my device (so only my commits were displayed). But in fact, each of us is responsible for the production of a game, a total of three games, and all members of the team participated in this assignment.

## Project Description:
The project include previous content in individual gamehub assignment. And we created three game in total: Wordle, Number Guessing and Google Dino. 

All of the games work but have a small issue but not influence game:
In wordle game we renew the function setRandomWord and now it can fetch word constantly. Sometimes it might fetch multiple words at the start of loading this page, only one second. 
But it doesn't matter and not influence the users' experience because after one second, it will decide a word constantly for user to guess. You can check it just at bottom of wordle game.
