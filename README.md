GameHub(Final Project, Team 10)
===================================

Instruction: This project was developed by Huy, Austin and Xuan. Since we were not familiar with the use of Folk during the development process, we all completed the work through my device (so only my commits were displayed). But in fact, each of us is responsible for the production of a game, a total of three games, and all members of the team participated in this assignment.

## Project Description:
The project include previous content in individual gamehub assignment. And we created three game in total: Wordle, Number Guessing and Google Dino. 

All of the games work but still have some small issue:
1. vite.config.json change but still cannot display our gamehub through webpage, if score please download it and use npm run dev (> <)
